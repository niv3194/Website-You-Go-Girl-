        Even if you are sick, overweight, over age 55, under age 21, married, divorced, rich, without a high school diploma, unemployed, or striving to make your next meal–you can dream big–because many dreamers begin their journey while life is kicking them in the teeth. Each You Go Girl article contributor typically shares a new dream story for a year.Other contributors have offered their dream encouragement for years with no end in sight!</p>
